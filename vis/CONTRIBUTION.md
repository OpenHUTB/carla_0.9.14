## Contribution
### Frontend
I am not very familiar with frontend stack and am actively looking for frontend contributors. The structure of this project also allows integration of other frontends.

### Backend
Although this project is initially specific to Carla simulator, the current structure of backend allows quite easy integration of other simulators/backends. I believe some other things like ROS, 
AirSim can be added as backends as well with quite few codes.
